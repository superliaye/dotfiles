Create a git commit following best practices:

1. Run git status and git diff to see changes
2. Analyze all changes (not just latest)
3. Create a commit message with:
   - Clear summary line
   - Detailed breakdown of changes
   - Why the changes were made
   - Build/test status if applicable

Always end with:
```

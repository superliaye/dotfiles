Clean up the code:

1. Identify issues:
   - Unused imports, variables, functions
   - Code style violations
   - Type issues (any, unknown casts)
   - Inconsistent patterns

2. Fix systematically (ask if major refactoring needed)

3. Run build/lint after changes to verify

4. Summarize what was cleaned up

Focus on safe, obvious improvements unless asked to do more.

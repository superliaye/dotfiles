Explain the code:

1. Read the relevant files
2. Understand the broader context (related files, dependencies)
3. Provide a clear explanation with:
   - What the code does
   - How it works (step by step)
   - Why it's designed this way
   - Key patterns or concepts used
   - Examples of usage if applicable

Keep it clear and practical.
